# Notes about mod versions

## Iron Chests
The version specified in the technic pack is the short _'1.6.4'_, whereas Iron
Chests had much more subversions. For the modpack, I chose the last one made,
but it is worth noting.

## Inventory Tweaks
This mod has the same problem as Iron Chests, where they had many subversions,
but the technic pack does not specify which, so again I just chose the last one
made.

Moreover, the version on technic does not show up on the archive as being
available for 1.6.4, so I'm just putting on the 1.6.2 mod, hoping it works.

## Magic Bees
This mod does not publish v2.1.12 on curseforge, but does publish v2.1.13. I
could not find v2.1.12 on any archive, so I'm settling with the one on
curseforge.
