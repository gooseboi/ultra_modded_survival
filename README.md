# Ultra Modded Survival

An attempt at recreating CaptainSparklez's ['Ultra Modded Survival'](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSUHnOQiYNg38N8I74dnXkr_w5GVOWBGD) modpack.

This is mostly based on an [old pack on technic which has been deleted and archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20140702081210/https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/details/ultra-modded-survival-pack.266012).
The version of the modpack this modpack is based on is dated to 2014/07/02 by
the Archive, which marks it to be close to the end of the series. I am not sure
if he added/updated any mods during the run of the series, so at least the
first version of this will be based on this version of the pack.
