## Zan's Minimap
The file from [mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/download/fctjzgq71e8lr9d/ZansMinimap1.6.4.zip) and the file from the [archive] differ.

mediafire: `sha256:2ca0cbddc07b43b778a9fe7d3143bb99f11361e68e616522893edc8811973c86`
archive:   `sha256:3a61908c9972d0063a18a94ccfd0366cc9a7ba2389590434272cd362adb13bb5`

I forgot where I got the mediafire link from, but I'm pretty sure it's
trustworthy. I doubt it got updated, but since they're zips I might check the
files to find the difference.

## Chat Bubbles
There is no download in the archive, and the only link I could find is this
mediafire
[link](https://www.mediafire.com/download/2rtcxqg6u3rax5y/ChatBubbles1.6.4.zip),
with hash
`sha256:d62736b312fac6372dfd6df3b5aa8827ebb499a78f67c6d54666ffe6363d1802` which
I obviously cannot add to the packwiz pack.

## OreSpawn
I assume that this is not added to the archive because the dev won't allow it,
but I'm not sure. I haven't submitted it, but the files are
[here](https://dangerzone-archive.weebly.com/orespawn.html), and the hash of
`1.6.4v17` is
`sha256:d9a353a62135d26140088f5e2657a3452bfbf292d50615f680e5cef6e9fa36e9`. The
reason I don't add them is because the files are behind gdrive.

## Extra Cells
The desired version is 1.6.8f, but this is not available as a binary. There is
a repo [here](https://github.com/ExtraCells/ExtraCells1) but no binaries are
available. I haven't gotten it to build yet, cuz I don't know gradle (luckily),
but with some elbow grease I'm pretty sure it'll work.

Hashes for the expected mod are available
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140402103626/https://drone.io/github.com/M3gaFr3ak/ExtraCells/files).

## Flans Mod
The desired version is 4.1.1. The [site](https://flansmod.com/download) has a downloads page, but none of the links work.

There is a [github](https://github.com/FlansMods/FlansMod), but I don't know if the old versions are there.

Moreover, there is the problem of content packs, which I haven't even tried to
look for, let alone find which ones Jordan had installed.

## Modular Powersuits Addons
There is a download
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/v5zkjhc43foffglyqryvq/AJhaSQ7GzsUPIflAz23iy0g/1.6.4?dl=0&rlkey=sp3oyedkpo4t23yxw36maal4q&subfolder_nav_tracking=1). I
submitted this to the archive, so I'm waiting on that to add it to packwiz.

## Nei Addons
I also submitted some versions to the archive, but the correct ones that
technic referes to are not available. There is also a source available
[here](https://github.com/bdew-minecraft/neiaddons), but I haven't tried
compiling, nor know if compiling it will yield anything present anywhere.
